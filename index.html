      <p class="about-me">After graduating college, I began my career in community banking, and while I liked my job, I

        development.

        <br>

        As a student at Thinkful, I have started on a train ride to develop software that makes all aspects our life

      <p class="about-me"> In my spare time I like to go on hikes with my dogs and read. I'm particularly fond of the Harry Potter series.If you are looking to hire a junior developer, please reach out! </p>

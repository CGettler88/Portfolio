      <p class="about-me">After graduating college, I began my career in community banking, and while I liked my job, I
        felt something was missing. That's when I started thinking of my passion: technology, specifically software
        development.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a student at Thinkful, I have started on a train ride to develop software that makes all aspects of our life

        <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Autonmous vehicle software development</li>
      </ul>
<br>   
      <p class="about-me"> In my spare time, I like to go on hikes with my dogs and read. I'm particularly fond of the Harry Potter series. If you are looking to hire a junior developer, please reach out! </p>

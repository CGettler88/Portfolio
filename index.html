      <h2>About Cristina</h2>
      <p class= "about-me">After graduating college, I began my career in community banking, and while I liked my job, I felt something was missing. That's when I started thinking of my passion: technology, specifically software development.
       <br>
<br> 

As a student at Thinkful, I have started on a train ride to develop software that makes all aspects our life easier. I look foward to connecting with junior and senior developers in all software development branches, but I am particularly interested in:</p>

          <li>robotics</li>
          <li>autonmous vehicle software development</li>
        </ul> 
        
 <p class="about-me">If you are looking to hire a junior developer, please reach out! </p>

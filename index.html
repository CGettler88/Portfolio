      <h2>About Cristina</h2>
      <p class= "about-me">After graduating college, I began my career in community banking, and while I liked my job, I felt something was missing. That's when I started thinking of my passion: technology, specifically software development.
        <br>
        <br>
As a student at Thinkful, I have started on the train tracks to develop software that makes our life easier. I look foward to connecting with junior and senior developers in all software development branches, but I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicle development.

If you are looking to hire a junior developer, please reach out!  </p>
